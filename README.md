# Python Battleground

If you are here, that means that you are ready to step into the world of programming in Python. This might be a great adventure!

Purpose of this project is to get your hands dirty by working with real life examples which you may encounter during your time at NiceProject (and not only).

## Scope

During this project you will be working with a lot of Python functionalities. Among others:

- conditional statements
- loops
- functions
- objects and their inheritance
- test libraries
- external libraries bringing new functionalities

... and much more!

## Requirements

While working on the project, we will focus on Python version 3.x. Python 2.x is deprecated (but still used in projects) and since 2020 will not be furtherly improved and supported. [You can find more about Python versions here.](https://www.guru99.com/python-2-vs-python-3.html#4)

PyCharm is a strongly recommended IDE for project purpose but you can choose environment which you like and which is the most suitable for your needs.

You will also need something version controlling system - GIT will be the best choice as we all use it on our daily basis


## Workflow

This repository will be a place where you will keep all of your work and progress. Create at least two branches. One you will use as a master branch for your project - you will not directly push your code into it.Instead, you will create Merge Requests from the rest of your branches to it.
